# Imaginary Planet

<img src="cover.png" width="900" />

These are the project files for the album Imaginary Planet, released Oct. 2020

This project was worked on from 2009 to 2020, mostly in Metallia's old house on Carlson Blvd, El Cerrito, CA.

I try to make everything I do open-source, why should an album be any different?

## Cloning
~This repository uses [git LFS](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage) (large file storage).~

`git lfs fetch --all`

This is disabled to save money now but I am happy to provide the files upon request.

## Software

All songs except Impending Doom were made with Ableton Live, some partly in Reason as well. Impending Doom was made with Logic.


## Missing Samples

If there happen to be any missing samples from the projects please let me know, I might have them somewhere.
